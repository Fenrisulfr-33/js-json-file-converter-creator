      "full": "Burning Bulwark protects the user from all effects of physical and special moves that target it during the turn it is used. If Burning Bulwark blocks an attack that would make contact with the user, the attacker becomes burned (unless they are immune). (Moves that are blocked do not activate other effects that require making contact, like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.) If the user goes last in the turn, the move will fail. The chance that Burning Bulwark will succeed also drops each time the user successfully and consecutively uses Endure, any protection move that only affects the user, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. Each time, the chance of success is divided by 3. Some moves will do damage through Burning Bulwark. Moves that break protection, like Feint, will do their full damage and remove the effects of Burning Bulwark. The Ability Unseen Fist allows contact moves to bypass Burning Bulwark. Burning Bulwark is an increased priority move that will go before most attacks in a turn.",
