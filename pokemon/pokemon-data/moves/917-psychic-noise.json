During these two turns, if the target uses a move with a healing property, such as Drain Punch, it will fail. Psychic Noise is a sound-based move, and can hit Pok√©mon even if they are behind a substitute. The Heal Block property of this move is considered an additional effect, and is thus blocked by Shield Dust and suppressed by Sheer Force.",
