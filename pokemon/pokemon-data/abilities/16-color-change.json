    "full": "Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move. If the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden. The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes. This ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack. In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves."
