If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle. This ability functions identically to insomnia in battle. Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."
