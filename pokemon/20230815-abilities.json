Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way paralysis, flinching, etc do. Most such moves, for example bide or rollout, are simply cut off upon loafing around. Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used. Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual. If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending. If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn. If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did. This ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap."

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way. Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected. For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user. This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle. This ability cannot ignore multitype at all. An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used. For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed. When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability. This ability functions identically to teravolt and turboblaze."

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way. Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected. For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user. This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle. This ability cannot ignore multitype at all. An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used. For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed. When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability. This ability functions identically to mold breaker and teravolt."

    "effect": {
      "shortEffect": "Bypasses targets' abilities if they could hinder or prevent moves.",
      "full": "This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target. For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat. If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way. Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected. For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user. This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle. This ability cannot ignore multitype at all. An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used. For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed. When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability. This ability functions identically to mold breaker and turboblaze."
